# Pixel 8 / 8 Pro Sultan's kernel (KernelSU + SUSFS)
### ⚠️ Warning

> **Anything you do with your device is at your own risk.**

Even though I personally test it on my Pixel 8, I provide no guarantees whatsoever. By default, this kernel should be treated as something that **will harm your device and wipe all your data**. You have been warned ‼️

Make full backups of your data and keep them in a safe place. Also, backup partitions that cannot be restored without a pre-existing backup, such as: `persist`, `efs`, `efs_backup`, `devinfo`, etc.
